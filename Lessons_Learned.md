# Notes/Thoughts/Lessons learned during development

**SUBROUTINE TO HANDLE ANIMATION/STATES**
The subroutine knows with static variables if it is the first entry or not. The subroutine resets the variable that tracks this
when it is done. The subroutine knows which frames of animation are next as well as the timer to track the time
between frames.


**For standing & crouching sprites**, (or any ground based sprites), **use a standard Y-Axis**. These sprites should have the same Y axis 
length , the highest sprite's Y axis length can be used. Not doing this causes sprites to be "jumpy". 

**For Left Facing Sprites**, to take Right Facing Sprites and use them to face left, flip the image on the X-Axis. 
**To get the proper X coordinate for a flipped horizontal sprite:**

xof=xwidth of last frame that was STANDING (standing state of animation)
cur_xwidth=current X width of current frame of animation
X=current X coordinate

**_current location facing left=x-(cur_xwidth-xof)_**
put toscreen,(x-(cur_xwidth-xof),y),cur_ani1

# Program Structure
A keyboard handler is running at all times. It uses the Win32 API. Every time a key is pressed or released 
a keyboard event occurs. This event causes a custom function that I wrote to execute. Inside of this function
is my custom keyboard routines.

Here is the basic program structure...
# UPDATE INPUT STATE
Read the keyboard buffer & key presses and also check for motions. 
# TRANSLATE INPUT STATE TO CURRENT STATE
Check to make sure the input_state is valid, if so translate it to current state.
# EXECUTE CURRENT STATE SUBROUTINE
The states can be anything, for example, punching, kicking, jumping, peforming special moves...etc...
<br>
Each state has its own subroutine.
<br>
The subroutine will make sure that the current state is valid to proceed. 
<br>
The subroutine will maintain its state with static variables.
<br>
The subroutine will control animation timing and X & Y coordinate movement.
<br>
The subroutine will control which frames of animation are valid.
<br>
The subroutine will execute and control sounds for specific animations.
<br>
The subroutine can turn the ability to attack/user input On & Off.
<br>
The subroutine will control and track its state from start to finish.
</br>

# GET THE CURRENT STATE ANMIATION FRAME POINTER
Return an image pointer to the main loop of the program so the current frame of animation can be shown.
